As he recovers he finds himself to be the only man in a wild western town inhabited by beautiful, gun slingin', whiskey drinkin' women. Peace, harmony and boredom abound in Puckerbush Gulch until word gets out that for the first time in twenty years, there's a man in their midst. Best friends become bitter foes as the sex-crazed cowgirls corral the Commander one by one. Lost in space with no way home, can our hero find true happiness, or will he be pushin' up daisies from pure exhaustion?",

It turns out, however, that their ship is the subject of a Paranoid experiment. In the end, it is up to the remaining crew Star Leaf to defend the artificial paradise of Chaos from the Paranoid fleet and the plans of the Solenoid leaders.",

Max meets Charlie's brother Vernon and is introduced to his new wife -- Karen. Facing Karen sends Max into an emotional tailspin, and he realizes that he must tell Mimi the truth about his indiscretion.",

Once upon a time, a band of scholars set out to write a new encyclopedia. By their ninth year, the grumpy grammarian of the group, Bertram Potts (Cooper), is up to \"S\" for slang. In order to brush up on modern lingo, the professor decides to attend a bawdy nightclub, where he meets Sugarpuss O'Shea (Stanwyck), a burlesque queen who spices up his language and steals his heart.

Shaw, as usual, gives a riveting performance, but Plummer's simmering portrayal of hate, love and confusion screams even louder than the blood curdling cries of Incas slaughtered by Pizarro's conquistadors across the dusty landscape.\nTwo cultures, worlds apart in language and tradition but eerily similar, each rival doomed by his own basic nature â blinding bigotry and undying belief in his own spiritual supremacy.",

Can anyone stop Lorna before her perverse stage show becomes a murderous reality?\nStarring the beautiful Janine Reynaud ( TWO UNDERCOVER ANGELS, KISS ME, MONSTER ), Jack Taylor ( THE GHOST GALLEON, THE NINTH GATE ) and Howard Vernon ( THE AWFUL DR.

Anatov-Oveyenko leads the attack and signs the proclamation dissolving the provisional government.",

Severe flooding threatens an Indiana town after a massive rainstorm taxes dams to the breaking point. As part of an emergency evacuation effort, armored car driver Tom and his uncle Charlie are recruited to collect cash from the town's banks and drive it to safety. However, a gang of thieves led by Jim plan to lay siege to the truck and steal the $3 million on board. After Jim attempts to ambush the truck, Tom hides the cash and reports the attempted theft to the local sheriff. However, the sheriff's lack of honesty soon becomes apparent; he puts Tom in a lockup and sets out to take the money for himself. As the flood waters rise, Tom has to escape from jail if he is to save both the townspeople's savings and his own life. Meanwhile, Jim and the sheriff are locked in a race to see who can find the $3 million first.",

This is the only video in the Jerry Springer home video series that is actually a full-length show, rather than just clipped highlights. Adara works and lives without a stitch of clothing to sheathe her body. Grocery shopping, walking around town, working as half of the duo entitled Scandalous, Adara simply feels it is more natural and more comfortable to be nude. Sitting on the stage, wearing nothing but thigh-high lace-up boots, she makes the case for nudity. While her boyfriend is supportive, her mother and sister are less than enthusiastic. Her tearful mother pleads with her to cover up. She is soon joined by best friend Amanda, whose boyfriend confronts her with the ultimatum: it's either me or your nudity.",

Fifteen years' agony, first chained to the Wheel of Pain grinding grain and then enslaved as a Pit Fighter, forge a magnificent body and indomitable spirit. Freed  one day by his owner, Conan, with his companions Subotai the Mongol  and Valeria, Queen of Thieves, sets forth upon his quest to learn \"the riddle of steel\" which his father prophesied would confer ultimate power, and to kill his enemy Thulsa Doom.",

With a dossier boasting 74 confirmed kills, he may be ready for his final assignment. But is he ready for his toughest?
