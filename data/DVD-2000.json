When Susan is found dead, Tom ironically is assigned to the case of finding the killer who is believed to be a KGB mole code-named \"Yuri.\" Tom could soon become a suspect in her murder when a indiscernible Polaroid negative of him is found at Susan's place. He only has a few short hours to find the killer before the negative can be processed. Also to make matters worse, he must contend with the ever-shrinking noose of the relentless dragnet put in place to find the ever elusive \"Yuri\"!",

From the time he was a young boy, Rudy is determined to join the Fighting Irish. But his blue-collar family only laughs at his ambitions - they know Rudy will follow his father and brother to the local steel mill. And, for four long years after high school, he does just that. But some dreams won't die, as Rudy proves when he goes to heroic, occasionally hilarious, lengths to win admission to Notre Dame. Once there, he becomes a walk-on player, serving as little more than a human tackling dummy against the startling players. Bloodied but unbeaten, Rudy wins the respect of legendary coach Ara Parseghian and the other Irish players, who give him one shot at gridiron glory. Based on a true story.",

        "description": "Based on the true story of a twice-divorced mother working as a low-level secretary at a Los Angeles law firm, a chronicle of a woman, without a law degree, who takes it upon herself to fight powerful corporate forces. Hired out of sympathy after her lawyer lost her personal injury suit, Brockovich stumbled upon the cover-up involving contaminated water in a small desert community, while working at the small law firm. Brockovich tracks a case of water poisoning created by PG&;E (Pacific Gas &; Electric) and champions it all the way up the judicial ladder—becoming instrumental in rallying the over 600 plaintiffs and in helping them win the largest class-action suit of its type.",

Featuring an all-star cast and new choreography, this charming tale of an adorable orphan named Annie captures all the fun of the original — but adds an unmistakable Disney touch!\nFor a young girl living a \"hard-knock life\" in a children's orphanage, things may seem pretty bad — especially at Christmas. But feisty Annie carries a song in her heart and hope in her locket — the only thing she has from her parents. One day, fed up with the dastardly Miss Hannigan (Academy Award winner Kathy Bates), Annie escapes the run-down orphanage determined to find her mom and dad. Her adventure takes her from the cold, mean streets of New York to the warm, comforting arms of big-hearted billionaire Oliver Warbucks — with plenty of music and mischief in between!\nFilled with memorable songs and magical moments, Disney's ANNIE brings this heartwarming story to a whole new generation.",

Such a movie is An Officer And A Gentleman, a timeless tale of romance, friendship and growth. Loner Zack Mayo (Richard Gere) enters Officer Candidate School to become a Navy pilot and in thirteen tortuous weeks he learns the importance of discipline, love and friendship. Louis Gossett, Jr. won an Academy Award for his brilliant portrayal of the tough drill instructor who teaches Zack that no man can make it alone. And while Gossett tries to warn the young officer about the local girls who will do anything to catch themselves pilot husbands, Zack eventually learns to love one (Debra Winger) while his fellow candidate, a memorable character portrayed by David Keith, struggles with a very different fate. An Officer And A Gentleman is a rich and satisfying story with moving performances that will stay with you long after the film has ended.",

Stewart plays a New York publisher entranced by a mysteriously bewitching young woman (Novak); mesmerizing supporting performances by the likes of Jack Lemmon, Ernie Kovacs, Hermione Gingold, Elsa Lanchester, and Janice Rule lend quirky comic charm to the proceedings. Cinematographer James Wong Howe gives us a glamorous vision of Manhattan, enhanced by George Duning’s sophisticated score (available here as an isolated track).",

Mexican bandit Colorado wants the gold for himself, and the local preacher and the editor of the newspaper also get gold fever. Everyone goes looking for the hidden treasure as the Indians dwindle their numbers with violent attacks. The search is monitored by U.S. calvary Sergeant Tibbs. Colorado captures Mackenna to lead him to the gold as death comes to those who show the most avarice.",

Through the history of mankind, the times that are most recorded in mythology are those of great deeds and fantastic adventures. Such a time was the Hyborean Age and the story of Conan the Barbarian. Cimmerian Conan is captured after his parents' savage murder by raiding Vanir led by Thulsa Doom, head  of the malignant snake-cult of Set. Fifteen years' agony, first chained to the Wheel of Pain grinding grain and then enslaved as a Pit Fighter, forge a magnificent body and indomitable spirit. Freed  one day by his owner, Conan, with his companions Subotai the Mongol  and Valeria, Queen of Thieves, sets forth upon his quest to learn \"the riddle of steel\" which his father prophesied would confer ultimate power, and to kill his enemy Thulsa Doom.",

When 007 discovers he is to be Scaramanga's next target, he is hurled into a deadly game of cat-and-mouse, continuing the search as he evades the killer on his trail. Bond must also contend with Scaramanga's exotic lover Andrea Anders, and Nick Nack, whose small size belies his lethal abilities. Even as 007 enlists the aid of sensuous Mary Goodnight, he must overcome ferocious odds to survive an explosive showdown on Scaramanga's remote island. His adventures draw him into a gripping boat pursuit, a wild automobile chase through Bangkok, and an unthinkable confrontation against an entire martial arts school.",

Thomas' rival is the bigger (and meaner) Diesel Ten, who has already put one of Thomas' allied engines, The Lady, out of commission.

        "description": "Director Julie Taymor brings her unique vision to Shakespeare's early, famously violent revenge tragedy. Titus Andronicus, the great Roman general, returns home victorious from a long war with the northern Goths during which all but his four remaining sons have died. Lucius, the eldest son, reminds Titus that part of the victory ritual is the human sacrifice of an enemy prisoner. Titus chooses the eldest son of Tamora, the Queen of the Goths, who has been brought back to Rome as a captive with her three sons and the Moor, Aaron. Though Tamora pleads for her son's life, Titus carries out the ritual, not out of cruelty but out of what he conceives to be religious devotion. Tamora and her two remaining sons, Chiron and Demetrius, vow revenge. With that, the tale of double revenge begins--first Tamora's and then Titus's.",

        "description": "A ratings disaster when it premiered on the ABC network on September 22, 1969 (and lasting a mere 16 weeks before cancellation), Music Scene now stands as a sublime time capsule of the \"flower power\" era. Although it was smartly conceived by the hipper-than-average producers of the controversial Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, the show was riskily scheduled opposite ratings juggernauts Gunsmoke and Laugh-In, and its fate was sealed. Now, with the passage of decades, these shows display a laudable effort to lure serious rock music into the pop-cultural mainstream--there were few if any opportunities for these acts to gain prime-time TV exposure, so it wasn't unusual to find Janis Joplin, Sly &; the Family Stone, or Crosby, Stills, Nash &; Young colliding on the guest list with bubble-gum pop stars like Bobby Sherman and MOR crooners like Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme.\nStruggling to bridge the generation gap, host comedian David Steinberg--with a group of five regular cohosts including Lily Tomlin and occasional guest hosts--is a well-chosen mouthpiece for Hollywood's anti-Nixon liberalism, able to distinguish the important (Joe Cocker, Richie Havens) from the ridiculous (the nonexistent Archies and their #1 hit \"Sugar Sugar\" are duly dismissed). This Volume 1 DVD offers four complete shows, combining sociopolitical comedy with a potpourri of music (either live or lip-synched) selected each week from Billboard magazine's Top 100 pop, rock, country, and soul charts. An additional 21 bonus performances are packed onto side B, along with Music Scene promo spots featuring the Rolling Stones. All in all, this may be one of the best DVDs to showcase nostalgic TV in a meaningful and entertaining way, by rescuing a short-lived series from oblivion to remind us of the very best (and not-so-best) that American pop culture had to offer during the height of the Vietnam War.",

        "description": "A compelling romance bound in tragedy, Il Grido is a fascinating missing link in the career of Michelangelo Antonioni, marking his transition from the neorealist impulses expressed in Le Amich (The Girl Friends, 1955) &; I Vinti (The Vanquished, 1952), toward the more subjectively stylized approach of such classic works are L'Avventura (1959), La Notte (1961) &; Red Desert (1964). Shot in Antonioni's native Po Valley region near Bologna, Il Grido focuses on individuals of the common classes rather then the bourgeoisie of his later films. From this humble and unpretentious subject matter, Antonioni fashions a spellbinding motion picture that keenly demonstrates his profound cinematic talents. His hypnotic compositions of bleak industrial landscapes enshrouded in grey fog provide the perfect tableaux for characters haunted by emotional detachment and psychological torment. The narrative follows Aldo, a young refinery mechanic who, when faced with the sudden end of a seven-year affair with a married woman (Alida Valli), abandons his past and embarks on an aimless quest with their young daughter in tow. His travels take him to the home of an old flame (Betsy Blair), to a filling station owned by a lonely widow (Dorian Gray) on a desolate stretch of highway, and into the arms of a prostitute in an impoverished fishing community (Lyn Shaw). But he can find no relief from his undying love for Irma and must return to her village, for adenouement that is unexpectedly shocking but inevitable.",

Robinson also features Academy Award-winner Celeste Holm, Lou Rawls, and Ann Magnuson. Fletcher McBracken (Fraser) is San Antonio artist and street performer who comes from a long line of men who have had “visions” of their future soul-mate. Roz Willoughby (Going) is a cynical and sexy con-artist who is out for one thing - money. She and her accomplice Elaine (Magnuson) make a cozy living fleecing rich men in a fine-art scheme in Los Angeles. When Fletcher thinks Roz is the woman he has seen in a vision, he has no idea she sees him as her next victim. With a rich score combining Chopin and traditional jazz, STILL BREATHING is film full of heart, soul and mystical connections.",

Liu's other son, Daming, who now lives in the Southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, arrives for a visit after hearing that Liu had died. Daming is happy to hear that the news of his father's death was greatly exaggerated, but as part of a younger generation that has adopted a Western-influenced lifestyle and business sense (including favoring showers over baths), he feels out of place in his father's world and there's a great emotional distance between the two. But when Erming disappears, the crisis brings Liu and Daming closer together, and Daming decides to extend his visit when he and Liu get word that the bathhouse is scheduled to be torn down in a few weeks.",

But now, the country he served so well has put him on trial for a rescue mission that went terribly wrong. For his attorney, he has chosen Marine Colonel Hays Hodges, a comrade-in-arms who owes his life to Childers. Hodges is not the best lawyer in the service, but Childers trusts him as a brother Marine who knows what it's like to risk death under fire. Bound by duty and friendship, Hodges reluctantly takes the case, even as he begins to doubt the man who saved his life in Vietnam three decades ago.",

So the first time he sees genteel Pat Pemberton (Katharine Hepburn) swing a five-iron, he decides to ink her to a pro contract. Not much meat on her, Mike later says, but whats there is choice. For this choicest of romantic comedies, George Cukor directs, Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin provide the Oscar®-nominated screenplay, and a deft cast plays various Damon Runyonesque types, including Aldo Ray as a dim-bulb palooka and Charles (Bronson) Buchinski as a tough guy who finds Pat tougher. Sports stars of the day (like Babe Didrikson Zaharias and Gussie Moran) add to the Jocks and Jills fun. Let the games begin!",

With the help of Lena, a strong-minded punk rock girl, he must find and protect Hap Ashby, a former baseball pitcher now living on Skid Row, and face Whistler in a final confrontation.",

        "description": "Lonely orphan James is sent to live with his wicked and greedy aunts after his parents' untimely deaths. Unwanted and forced to perform menial chores, the boy dreams about traveling to New York City – a place his father once told him was where dreams come true. When James meets a mysterious old man who gives him a bag of magical, glowing crocodile tongues and tells him that marvelous things are about to happen, he accidentally spills the contents of the bag at the base of a barren old peach tree. To his astonishment, an enormous peach begins to sprout on the branch. When a glowing tunnel later appears, the frightened boy ventures inside the peach and meets a number of new friends, including a centipede, earthworm, ladybug, glowworm, grasshopper, and spider. Rolling out to sea, the giant peach launches its passengers on a series of wildly imaginative adventures with New York City as their final destination.",

        "description": "Part conspiracy theory and part religious message, Left Behind (based on the first in a series of runaway bestsellers by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins) is a passable, occasionally compelling thriller that turns the rapture and the ascendance of the Antichrist into something resembling a Robert Ludlum espionage potboiler. The beginning, though, is pure Stephen King: as morose pilot Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson) steers his jet plane toward London, comely flight attendant Hattie Daniels (Chelsea Noble) informs him that a number of passengers have disappeared--at 37,000 feet, leaving their neatly pressed clothes behind. And they're not the only ones who've gone missing. The mass disappearances throw the world into chaos, and the sinisterly compelling Nicolae Carpathia (Gordon Currie), head of the U.N., selflessly steps in to help broker peace among the world's nations. But is he as good intentioned as he seems?",

Featuring the surreal Alice in Wonderland takeoff \"Don't Come Around Here No More,\" the Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway-starring rise and fall narrative of \"Into the Great Wide Open,\" and finally, the tragic murder story (starring Kim Basinger) of \"Mary Jane's Last Dance,\" PLAYBACK serves as a testament to the quality of both Tom Petty's music and videos.",

It features the song Move On Up by Curtis Mayfield in its opening scene. The low-budget movie satirizes television and the counterculture of the early 1970s. The film was originally produced to be shown at the Channel One Theater on East 60th St. in New York, a venue that featured R-rated video recordings shown on three television sets, which was a novelty to the audiences of the time. The news desk satire, including the signature line \"Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow\" was later used by Chase for his signature Weekend Update piece on Saturday Night Live, although in the film he does not appear in that segment.",

An early example of what Allen called his 'slapdash' approach to comedy, BANANAS' broad, fast humor and rapid-fire witticisms form a dazzling kaleidoscope of \"inspired ingenuity and comic artistry\" (Look Magazine). When bumbling product-tester Fielding Mellish (Allen) is jilted by his girlfriend, Nancy (Louise Lasser), he heads to the tiny republic of San Marcos for a vacation...only to become kidnapped by rebels! Once the band of rebels seize power, their leader goes crazy, and they replace him with Mellish, thinking he can save the country. But when Mellish is nabbed by the FBI, he is put on trial for subversion and in a side-splitting courtroom showdown — including the most hilarious self-cross examination ever — Woody Allen proves beyond a doubt that he is not only our most gifted satirist...he's a master comic artist.",

Catch a Fire, their first Island album released in 1973, introduced them to an international rock audience. Here the principal figures in the creation of Catch a Fire tell the story of how this record was designed to cross-over. The program features a unique interview and performance with Bunny Wailer, rare archive interviews with Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, and contributions in words and music from many of those who performed on the record, like bass players Family Man Barrett, Robbie Shakespeare and Bob's wife Rita Marley. Featuring rare home movies of the Wailers in Jamaica, previously unseen footage, and unique performances of many album tracks such as Stir It Up, Stop That Train and Kinky Reggae, this is a documentary that will endlessly fascinate the viewer and is both a genuine tribute to a great supergroup and an insight into a true reggae Classic Album.",

        "description": "With its imaginative stories of secret agents in 1960s swinging Britain, The Avengers combines science fiction with fantasy, fashion and a unique sense of style, and can rightly claim its place as a prime example of the spy-fi genre. We may be in the 21st century, but The Avengers retains a fascination that is as fresh today as it was when it first took off on the small screen. Exciting, quirky, bizarre and quintessentially British, The Avengers pioneered many themes of modern television whilst introducing three of its best ever characters Steed (Patrick Macnee) Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman) and Emma Peel (Diana Rigg).",
