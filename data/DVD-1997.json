With so many young men overseas fighting the Axis, there is a danger that professional baseball will be shut down for the duration of the war. A well-known candy manufacturer, Walter Harvey, contrives the idea to create a professional baseball league for women; both the keep the sport alive and to make a buck or two. Dottie is recruited by a scout for this new league but refuses to go unless her sister is allowed on the team. These women, along with their team-mates, begin a journey that opens up a whole new world, far beyond that of the baseball diamond, lead by team manager, Jimmy Dugan, a washed-up star ruined by alcohol and angered and embarrassed to be the coach of a girl's team.",

Guinevere has promised to marry King Arthur not only because his army will protect her country, but because she truly loves him for his wise and gentle ways. As she prepares to enter Camelot as its new queen, a chance encounter with Lancelot awakens conflicting and powerful emotions within her. For Arthur, she represents a once-in-a-lifetime chance at true love and a beloved queen for his kingdom. Likewise, the king comes to see Lancelot as possessing the honor and bravery of a true Knight. He welcomes them both into his city and into his heart, never foreseeing how his great capacity for love and trust opens the doors for his betrayal.",

Meanwhile, a sultry Italian divorcée (Sophia Loren) opens a restaurant at the local bait shop, alarming the locals who worry she'll scare the fish away. But she's less interested in seafood than she is in cooking up a hot time with Max.",

The excitement starts when the USS Missouri welcomes aboard musicians and caterers set to provide entertainment during the famed battleship's last voyage. The visitors throw a party, all right. A war party. Led by a rogue CIA operative (JFK's Tommy Lee Jones) and a turncoat officer (Lethal Weapon's Gary Busey), they're really killer-elite commandos out to hijack the ship's nuclear arsenal. They overpower the crew. Except for one man. \"I'm just a cook,\" that man says. But he's a cook with a recipe for action. He's ex-Navy SEAL and highly decorated combat operative Casey Ryback (Seagal). Relying on his slam-bang martial-arts skills and equipped with enough hardware to single-handedly wage World War III, Ryback turns the Missouri's deck and below deck areas into guerilla combat zones. All hands ready, action fans!",

In return for the favor, the devil requires, in typically Faustian fashion, that Simmons lead Hell's Army for the destruction of humankind. Blessed in life with extraordinary killing skills, Simmons is even more deadly with the backing of his new master and the changling powers he has at his disposal. As he begins to discover and exercise his new strengths, he encounters two figures who direct him to use his powers in order to serve two different agendas. Cogliostro encourages Spawn to fight the devil and become a new champion for humankind, while Clown goads Spawn into continuing to serve his new master and lead the Armageddon.",

Riggs is still the reckless daredevil, but now he counts the odds before bucking them.  He cracks more jokes too. \"I thought in this film I could take Riggs in a completely different direction,\" Gibson says.  \nFun it is. And exciting, from its breathless, opening chase through L.A. streets to its ragining gun-battle finale. In between, there's a six-strorey plummet from a window, a booby-trapped toilet, a Houdini-like underwater escape and the incredible destruction of a chic hillside stilt house. \"With Mel and Danny, Joe is the third stooge,\" director Richard Donner says. That makes three drop-dead funny guys. It's police procedure, Lethal style. And it's yours to enjoy as the duo draws a bead on criminals hiding behind diplomatic immunity.",

Tony Bennett's MTV Unplugged: The Video features 22 of Tony's greatest songs recorded in the unplugged setting. Also included are several bonus tracks -- the music video for \"Steppin' Out With My Baby\" (from the Steppin' Out album) -- plus exclusive interview footage featuring Tony Bennett, Elvis Costello and others.",

It was a role that brought Larry Flynt both ruin and glory. Flynt becomes the unlikely champion of the First Amendment when he takes his fight against the Rev. Jerry Falwell all the way to the Supreme Court.",

When Alan asks Cesare about his future, Cesare answers that he will die before dawn. The next morning Alan is found dead. Francis suspects Cesare of being the murderer, and starts spying on him and Dr. Caligari. The following night Cesare is going to stab Jane in her bed, but softens when he sees the beautiful woman, and instead of committing another murder, he abducts her. Francis pursues the fleeing Dr. Caligari, and sees him disappear into a madhouse, where he is sure he will find the truth behind all these mysterious events...",

In order to stop the dictator's evil plot, Interpol agent Chun-Li forms a rocky partnership with Major Guile of the United States Air Force.

Will Shadaloo succeed, or will the World Warriors beat M.Bison to the punch?",

Also inheriting command of her late father's ship, The Morning Star, Morgan and her men set off on a mission to lay claim to her fortune. In an effort to decipher the map's contents, she buys the handsome, educated William Shaw at a slave auction. A swindler and cheat who has finally been snared, Shaw joins the crew of The Morning Star and helps Morgan steal another portion of the map. Together they set sail in a race to beat the sinister pirate Dawg Brown to the legendary treasure of Cutthroat Island.",

The inhabitants of this once-flourishing planet cling to life on incredible floating cities, their existence constantly threatened by Smokers — bands of marauding pirates who roam the featureless surface of Waterworld. For the survivors, one chance remains: a solitary hero, known only as the Mariner. Battling the Smokers and their ruthless leader, the Deacon, the Mariner sets out with a beautiful woman and a mysterious little girl on a search for a new beginning.",

One of the bestselling albums of all time, RUMOURS' impeccable songwriting, lush vocal harmonies, and polished production stand as testament to the band's cohesive powers--a fact made even more remarkable by the romantic tensions roiling amongst its members at the time (Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were ending their long-term romantic relationship; Christine and John McVie were getting a divorce). This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series recounts the making of Fleetwood Mac's career-making opus through interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and live performances of timeless gems such as \"Don't Stop,\" \"Dreams,\"\"Go Your Own Way,\" \"You Make Loving Fun,\" \"The Chain,\" and more.",

While the community thinks him a crackpot, he finds a believer in the esteemed hunter/explorer Sir John Roxton, who befriends Malone. Malone is introduced to Paula White, whose father was left behind in the Amazon outback to contend with the mammoth creatures; it's the father's diary, featuring sketches of the dinosaurs, that's proof positive for Challenger of their existence. Soon a rescue mission is under way and Paula, Malone, Challenger and Roxton are awestruck by the presence of brontosaurs, pterodactyls and allosaurs right before their eyes! The turbulent assaults of these prehistoric monsters, unexpected encounters and a frenzied volcano sequence make this a spellbinding cinematic experience that won't be forgotten...",
