Hayley Mills plays Mary Clancy, who, with her best friend Rachel Devery (June Harding), succeeds in driving the Mother Superior (Rosalind Russell) to distraction with an endless number of practical jokes. Just when there appears to be no hope for the school's two most incorrigible students, they get a little help from Sisters Celestine (Binnie Barnes) and Constance (Camilla Sparv). During Christmas break, Mary remains at the school and is touched by the Sisters' celebration of the Yule. Rachel first doubts Mary's sincerity, but later follows Mary's example. Their graduation is both a relief and celebration for the Mother Superior.",

But he soon realizes that the best way to catch this killer, known as the Tooth Fairy, is to find a way to get inside the killer's mind. And the closest thing to that would be to probe the mind of another killer who is equally brilliant and twisted. For Graham, that means confronting his past and facing his former nemesis, the now-incarcerated Dr. Lecter.",

Superstar Charlie Sheen (Terminal Velocity), D.B. Sweeney (Fire in the Sky) and Randy Quaid (The Long Riders) star in this pedal-to-the-metal, full-throttle thriller that's your best bet for curve-hugging, edge-of-your-seat entertainment! Benjy Taylor (Sweeney) is a young cop with an eye for cars and fast women. He goes undercover at a Porsche garage that doubles as a chop shop; the seductive world of his target, Ted Varrick (Sheen), may be his undoing. The midnight joyrides, ultra-slick parties and Varrick's sexy sister (Lana Harris, The Fourth War) help sway Taylor into believing that his new fast friend has the kind of life he wants... even though Varrick may be guilty of much more than car theft... and Taylor may be in much deeper than he thinks. TV veteran Peter Werner (Don t Cry, It s Only Thunder) directed this action-packed stylish thriller written by legendary writer/producer Dick Wolf (Law &; Order) and featuring a strong supporting cast that includes Bill Duke (Predator), R.D.

Set in elegant Monte Carlo and dramatic Cornwall in the 1930s, this drama stars Charles Dance as the sophisticated Maxim de Winter and Emilia Fox as the young woman who becomes the second Mrs. de Winter. When Maxim de Winter proposes to such a young woman no one is more surprised than the circle of society friends who learn the intriguing news, especially as his new wife is the opposite of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who mysteriously died in a tragic drowning accident. After Maxim takes his new wife back to his home, the ancient and magnificent Manderley, it soon becomes evident that the shadow of Rebecca is all-pervasive, nurtured all the more by the sinister gothic housekeeper Mrs. Danvers. The new Mrs. de Winter begins to uncover the darkness of the past that taints the present and threatens to haunt her future...",

Widower Jackie Elliot and his firstborn, fellow miner Tony, take a dim view of 11 year-old second son Billy's poor record in boxing class, which worsens when they discover he sneakily transferred to the neighboring, otherwise girls-only-attended ballet class. Only one schoolmate, closet-gay Michael Caffrey, encourages Billy's desire, aroused by the teacher, who judged him talented enough for private lesson, to train and try out for the world-renowned Royal Ballet audition. Only the prospect of a fancy career unimagined in the pauper quarter may twist pa and big brother's opposition to indispensable support.",

While Barris gains notoriety as a dynamic television producer--creating such innovative and popular shows as \"The Newlywed Game\" and the self-hosted \"The Gong Show\"--he regularly executes assassinations for the United States government. As ratings rise, Barris incorporates his shows into his secret life, providing a cover for his covert missions. As Barris basks in the glamour of his two worlds, his life begins to spiral out of control. He is torn between the woman who loves him and the mysterious woman of his fantasies. Just as he receives mass criticism from the public who accuses him of contaminating the airwaves,  he finds himself marked for death by an operative.",

'My Left Foot' director Jim Sheridan focuses on the father-son relationship, as well as the long-running appeal against their sentences, led by their determined solicitor (Emma Thompson).",

Discouraged and tired of a life of wine, women and little song, Jolson turns to his friend and manager (William Demarest) who enlists him to entertain troops during the war. There he falls in love with and marries a beautiful army nurse (Barbara Hale), who encourages Al to sing again. Get set for an exciting array of Jolson's most popular songs in this electrifying and true-to-life story as JOLSON SINGS AGAIN!",

The damage extends beyond one kilometer from the center of explosion. The use of biological or chemical weapon is heavily suspected. The reward is W300,000,000.00 (Mars currency) to find out the perpetrator. Short of funds as usual, the crew of the Bebop is lured into the investigation by the staggering amount of money they could possibly receive for being able to accurately point the blame. They start a search on their own, and so begins the adventures of the young slacker, Spike Spiegel, and his cohort, the ex-cop, Jet Black, leading their gang of bounty hunters on the trail of an elusive nemesis.",

Heisenberg makes a covert trip at great risk to see Bohr and his wife Margrethe in Copenhagen, but the meeting ends in disaster. Why did Heisenberg go to Denmark, and what did the two men say to each other? What happened during this pivotal meeting that was a defining moment of the modern nuclear age?",

Onstage, Zappa is a live wire, the audience is appropriately rambunctious, and the band--an especially potent incarnation of the famous Mothers of Invention--is tight as could be. The film amounts to a three-hour musical carnival whose participants lack any trace of artistic or personal inhibition. Zappa, who died in 1993, always worked with consummate musicians, and Baby Snakes showcases the cream of the crop: Terry Bozzio (one of the greatest drummers ever to command a kit), bassist Patrick O'Hearn, keyboard wizard Tommy Mars, and even pop chameleon Adrian Belew.",

At the Pipe Masters surf competition on the North Shore of Oahu, more is at stake for Anne Marie than the pressure of competing in one of the world's most dangerous, aggressive and male-dominated sports. She must first win a dreaded contest within. Sharing a beach shack with her best friends Eden and Lena, and her rebellious younger sister Penny, Anne Marie lives for the adrenaline-charged surf scene, rising before dawn every day to charge the Pipeline's deadly waves. Things change when a pro football team with slovenly habits and fat wallets checks in. Like it or not, Anne Marie starts losing her balance--and finding it--as she falls for quarterback Matt Tollman. Suddenly there are options: trophy wife or trophy winner? But there's really only one choice for someone like Anne Marie.",

        "description": "A squad of players, some 300 strong and armed with musical instruments, takes over the field, commanding attention with their stirring, spectacular display of choreography and musicianship. The football contest's controlled mayhem makes way for the blaring sound of trumpets and the heart-thumping rhythm of drums. Into this rigorous, ritualistic world comes a kid from a different culture. Devon Miles, a young, gifted hip-hop drummer from Harlem, wins a full music scholarship to Atlanta A&;T University with the hopes of gaining a spot as a drummer on the school's renowned marching band's drumline. Devon, sporting a talent that is both raw and undisciplined, has one problem: He marches to the beat of his own drum. Surmounting overwhelming odds, he snares a spot as a starter, much to the disdain of a resentful senior class band member, Sean Taylor, who dismisses the freshman's skills as bogus. When Taylor discovers something amiss about Devon's abilities, he alerts Dr. Lee, the school's demanding, dedicated band director, who suspects that the upstart talent may have duped the school into awarding him his scholarship. That situation threatens not only Devonâ¿¿s future at the school but, more immediately, his spot on the band's drumline just before the heralded Big Southern Classic, one of the region's most popular musical competition, spotlighting some of the area's best college bands and the winner-take-all jackpot of $100,000 for the school. Now, with so much money, and possibly his own job, at stake, can Dr. Lee afford to pass up such a prize by keeping his star drummer on the sidelines?",
