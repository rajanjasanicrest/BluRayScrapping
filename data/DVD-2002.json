Stationed in the boonies on the Canadian border, they spend the bulk of their time playfully toying with speeders and taking impounded sports cars for spins on the open highway. When they're not on the road, they try to stay on the good side of their fatherly mentor, Captain O'Hagan, and avoid their tactless, thick-necked compatriot, Officer Rod Farva. All in all, they find their work to be pleasantly unchallenging. However, once the state targets their low volume station for a potential budget slash, the guys decide to buckle down to impress the higher ups. Things look bleak until, unexpectedly, the State Troopers' new \"by the book\" attitude uncovers a drug smuggling operation running across the border to Canada. Sensing salvation, the Troopers race the clock to crack the ring and save their jobs. But they aren't the only ones in the hunt.",

Now a married-with-children high-school chemistry teacher and baseball coach in Texas, Jim's team makes a deal with him: if they win the district championship, Jim will try out with a major-league organization. The bet proves incentive enough for the team, and they go from worst to first, making it to state for the first time in the history of the school. Jim, forced to live up to his end of the deal, is nearly laughed off the try-out field—until he gets onto the mound, where he confounds the scouts (and himself) by clocking successive 98 mph fastballs, good enough for a minor-league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Jim's still got a lot of pitches to throw before he makes it to The Show, but with his big-league dreams revived, there's no telling where he could go.",

John is a recovering addict and for him it's the perfect job, as he can relate completely with the self-absorbed eccentrics he services. But when his boss Ann tells John that she is planning to abandon the drug business for herbal cosmetics, John's life is thrown into disarray. With no future plans, he sees black clouds heading his way. Coincidentally, he runs into Marianne, an old girlfriend and former addict who has returned to New York to be with her dying mother. John sees Marianne as his redemption and starts to pursue her, but she doesn't want to be reminded of her past. When the murder of an Upper West Side woman involved in a drug transaction has the police scouring the town for suspects, John thinks they are following him, and the strain upon his life and his hopes for the future become harder and harder to bear.",

In a rural province of France, a mysterious creature is leaving a trail of mutilated corpses across the countryside, savagely killing scores of women and children. Unseen, possessed of enormous strength and a seemingly near-human intelligence, the beast has eluded capture for years. Desperate to end the growing unrest of the populace, the King sends in a renowned scientist and his Haudenosaunee blood brother, an unconventional team whose combined methods and capabilities may finally bring the beast down. But what these men find, when finally confronted with the true nature of the beast, is more shocking than anyone could have anticipated.",

His buddies Dennis, Elliot, and Vinny have their own commitment problems. Dennis (Kevin Bacon) isn't sure he wants to stay away from his buddies long enough to get his music career going in Hollywood; Elliot (John Malkovich) knows that he's homosexual but thinks that being gay means fitting all sorts of ugly stereotypes -- stereotypes he is determined to avoid at all costs; and Vinny (Tony Spiridakis) commits himself all too frequently and often to the nearest desirable female. Meanwhile, cousin Al (Joe Mantegna) is in trouble with his wife, and only the intervention of a well-intentioned psychotic (Jamie Lee Curtis) can put him back on the right track.",

It isn't long before vengeful thugs come calling to his Las Vegas trailer-park home, however, and Jack has to flee town with his drug-dealing best buddy, Pilot. The two decide to travel to Seattle -- in the week preceding Kurt Cobain's suicide -- and along the way they encounter a succession of drifters, losers, and hangers-on, including a sweet-hearted prostitute named Cassie.",

The cops pressure her to help them bring down Ordell, threatening prison if she refuses. With a sympathetic bail bondsman, who understands her restlessness only too well, Jackie arrives at a bold almost foolhardy plan to play off these opposing forces against each other. Matters are complicated by Ordell's confederates, Louis Gara and Melanie Ralston, who have agendas of their own. By appearing to cooperate with both sides, Jackie attempts to outfox them both and walk away with a half-million-dollar payday!",

She's tough as nails. She won't take shit and she won't take sides. She lives in the not-too-distant future where biology is used to kill, not cure, in a country devastated by Civil War. Every man wants her. No man can have her. She's a woman with high standards in a world of lowest common denominators. She's not about to waste her time with a man unless he has a really big one and knows how to use it--a brain, that is. It's been a long time since Barb's been on anybody's side other than her own. But when she wants to, she can more than match any man. There's nothing she can't handle. You can blast her and beat her, slash her and shoot her, drag her and diss her. But, whatever you do, just don't call her \"babe...\"",

Attenborough pops up in the most remote, most exotic locales, with occasional comic effect: at one point, night-vision cameras capture the rare sight of the nocturnal kiwi as it forages for food on a New Zealand beach; the camera pans to reveal scant paces away our guide shining a flashlight on the nonplussed bird.",

Malone is introduced to Paula White, whose father was left behind in the Amazon outback to contend with the mammoth creatures; it's the father's diary, featuring sketches of the dinosaurs, that's proof positive for Challenger of their existence. Soon a rescue mission is under way and Paula, Malone, Challenger and Roxton are awestruck by the presence of brontosaurs, pterodactyls and allosaurs right before their eyes! The turbulent assaults of these prehistoric monsters, unexpected encounters and a frenzied volcano sequence make this a spellbinding cinematic experience that won't be forgotten...",

Despite these handicaps, they are soon dancing to the sounds of Donna Summer, Hot Chocolate, Gary Glitter, Sister Sledge, and Tom Jones.",

Now a married-with-children high-school chemistry teacher and baseball coach in Texas, Jim's team makes a deal with him: if they win the district championship, Jim will try out with a major-league organization. The bet proves incentive enough for the team, and they go from worst to first, making it to state for the first time in the history of the school. Jim, forced to live up to his end of the deal, is nearly laughed off the try-out field—until he gets onto the mound, where he confounds the scouts (and himself) by clocking successive 98 mph fastballs, good enough for a minor-league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Jim's still got a lot of pitches to throw before he makes it to The Show, but with his big-league dreams revived, there's no telling where he could go.",

Fenton recounts in a series of flashbacks, how \nhe and his brother grew up in a very loving family, raised by their widowed father. All that \nchanged, the day his father awoke, believing he had been visited by an angel and given a \nmission to destroy \"demons\" - seemingly normal looking people, who walked this earth as \npure evil. Fenton's father, and then his brother Adam, swore to carry out this 'divine' \nmission. Fenton refused to participate in the killings. Out of loyalty however, he refused to \ngo to the police, until now. The FBI agent follows Fenton to the family's rose garden only to \nbe surprised that neither evil nor innocence are what they seem.",
