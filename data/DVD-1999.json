As they arrive in the tiny oppressed village, they begin to realize that they are caught in a horrible case of mistaken identity and must truly fight for their lives against the evil marauder El Guapo. They cowardly run for their lives while the village is almost destroyed until they realize the importance of their mission and are forced to use real cunning and bravery to try to defeat the villain's hordes in order to prove that the Three Amigos are as truly as courageous and heroic as they appeared onscreen.",

This all changes when Bobby gets a new coach who lets him stand up for himself. Bobby finally releases years of pent up rage and is transformed into the most devastating tackler on the team.

With few resources and virtually no clue about winter sports, it's an uphill course for this troupe from the tropics who are sliding on thin ice as they go for the gold in Calgary, Canada. Refusing to let anything stand in their way, these four Jamaicans enlist the help of a down-and-out ex-champion American slider named Irv. Unavoidably drawn back to a sport he had come to loathe, Irv is faced with coaching a team of complete novices. But once committed, he is determined to turn them around and to somehow right the wrongs of his own failed career. It's a bumpy ride but with pride, determination, and dignity, the bobsledders make their impossible dreams come true.",

        "description": "Patsy Cline was the first female solo artist to be elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame. Thirty-two years after her untimely death in a plane crash in Tennessee, her \"Greatest Hits\" album sold over six million copies. Loved by her fans today as much - if not more - than she was at the height of her fame, the life, the loves and most of all the voice of Patsy Cline is legendary. This film tells the story of the passionate, fun-loving, soft-spoken, loud-living life of one of country music's - and one of popular music's - greatest singing stars. This film covers the years 1956 through 1963, from her rise to fame and the top of the charts through TB talent shows and country bars - through her turbulent marriage to Charlie Dick and the demands of touring which would lead to the fatal plane crash.",

When Joe's peaceful existence is shattered by poachers, Jill and zoologist Gregg O'Hara (Bill Paxton) rescue their innocent friend and move him to the safety of an animal conservancy in California. But Joe's safety is short-lived. No longer a myth, his notoriety makes him a target for an enemy from his past -- a ruthless hunter who will do anything to capture the Mighty Joe.",

Girls like Genevieve and Tiana, who mysteriously vanish after an online conversation with the cunning cyber-predator. Detective Mike Gage has a personal stake in the case: Genevieve is his daughter.\nWhen Tiana's corpse – Tortured, pierced and scarred – is discovered in the river, Gage realizes that time is running out for Genevieve. Taking sadistic delight in Gage's desperation, Captain Howdy sends the detective a series of taunting e-mails, challenging him to a deadly online game of cat and mouse, and drawing him into his \"Modern Primitive\"world – a strange land of fetish bars, S&;M, Body Modification and Goth-Rock.",

In a series of explosive chases, brutal confrontations and impossible escapes, including a motorcycle pursuit through Saigon, Bond and Wai race to stop the presses on Carver's next planned news story--global pandemonium.",

When a mysterious TV repairman gives them a new remote control, the pair are transported into the world of Pleasantville like it or not. They find themselves trapped in an alternate reality where the town exists in black and white--in a white bread world without passion or violence. But the teenagers have also brought an unexpected--and double-edged--gift to Pleasantville: a sense of possibility that spreads like wildfire throughout the town. There can be no turning back once the citizens begin experiencing such strange wonders as sex, art, rain... and ideas.",

With the Cold War over and defense budgets slashed, the entire Universal Soldier team is facing elimination, including SETH, the super-computer that controls the ultra-warriors. Knowing that his days are numbered, SETH decides to seek revenge by destroying his creators and implementing a reign of terror on the outside world. Morphing into human form as the quintessential Universal Soldier, SETH begins to unleash his wicked plan with the aid of his top soldier. When conventional military strength fails to thwart his efforts, Luc must take charge. As Luc faces SETH and his team of unstoppable soldiers, a battle pitting man against machine and good against evil ensues, offering the kind of high-intensity sci-fi action you've come to expect from Van Damme in a story you won't soon forget.",

Burned by a string of failed relationships, Mackenzie's fear of commitment has intensified into outrageous extremes of paranoia. When he finds himself falling for the sweet-faced butcher at his local meat shop, he sees it as a final chance for love to overcome his painful cynicism. Feeling he has squelched his nagging fears, Mackenzie marries the woman. But his anxiety quickly manifests itself in the conviction that his betrothed is actually an infamous axe murderer whose antics are described in juicy detail in each week's issue of the Weekly World News.",

While the painting depicts people gathered on an island in the Seine, the musical goes beyond simply describing their lives. It is an exploration of art, of love, of commitment. Seurat connected dots to create images; Lapine and Sondheim use connection as the heart of all our relationships.",

After he's been double-crossed by his partner and wife, he wants some \"payback\" for the betrayal he's endured and the money he's owed. However after Porter learns that his partner has used the money to join \"The Outfit,\" he decides that they owe him instead. With the aid of a prostitute he used to work for, he pursues what he's entitled to. The theatrical version and director’s cut share the same material. Although they are similar, the endings are not. Porter’s more edgy, brutal and less humorous in the director’s cut. Also the film's color is less noir-suggestive and more dynamic looking. Some of the actors have changed too. Other changes include a score replacement, narration removal, and no softening quips. Either way, ‘Payback’ is a tour de force of singleminded unfettered brutality!",

Meanwhile, arriving from Paris is the beautiful and mysterious Jane Fuller, claiming to be the victim's daughter.

When she persists, he confides in her that he had made a commitment to his late widowed seamstress mother that he will wed any woman who will manage to survive on just Rs.500/-, for 90 days. She finds out that this sum is equivalent to just 35 shillings but readily accepts this challenge. She also informs him that her late father had also imposed a condition that she must wed a male who will turn £500 into £15000 within the same period. Epifania then finds employment with an Italian firm, ends up re-organizing, and turning up the firm's profits. At the end of 90 days, she goes to meet Kabir and discovers that he has not only given all the money away but also has no interest whatsoever in marrying her.",

But men like Sir Thomas More, who love life yet have the moral fiber to lay down their lives for their principles, are found in every century. Concentrating on the last seven years of English chancellor's life, the struggle between More and his King, Henry VIII, hinges on Henry's determination to break with Rome so he can divorce his current wife and wed again, and good Catholic More's inability to go along with such heresy. More resigns as chancellor, hoping to be able to live out his life as a private citizen. But Henry will settle for nothing less than that the much respected More give public approval to his headstrong course.",

However, a tug-of-war with his friend Zoe sends his blanket to a faraway land, and Elmo in hot pursuit. Facing life without his cherished blanket, Elmo musters all of his determination and courage and heads off on an action-packed rescue mission that plunges him into Grouchland, a place full of grouchy creatures, stinky garbage and the villainous Huxley. Along the way, Elmo learns an important lesson about sharing, realizing that he was selfish with his friend and responsible for what happened.",

Fictionalizing only the name of his television show, — what is normally called The Jerry Springer Show, is now called \"The Jerry Show\" — Springer plays himself as a man who fronts a chair-throwing, dog-and-pony trash TV show which gets high ratings in the backwoods, armpit communities of America. The story revolves around two sets of guests coming to Los Angeles to be on the show. First, the Zorzak family has slutty 19-year-old Angel, sleeping with her stepdad. When her mom finds out, she seeks revenge by sleeping with Angel's fiancé, Willie. The second group consists of Starletta, who caught her man, Demond, sleeping with her best friend, Vonda. This makes all of them perfect for stardom on The Jerry Show. As all these guests arrive for their big day on national television, more chaos ensues with Springer getting propositioned by Angel and her mother. Even crew members show their stripes by getting involved in the sexual escapades with the guests. The whole scenario is finally brought to a knockdown, gender-bending finale live on national television -- right where it belongs.",

        "description": "From Stephen King, the best selling novelist of all time, comes the terrifying tale of a town besieged by evil. The inhabitants of a picturesque sleepy little town on a small island off the coast of Maine find themselves completely cut off from the rest of the world when they are hit by the worst storm of the century. As snow steadily buries everything familiar, terror arrives in the form of an evil stranger. As streets disappear and an eerie darkness envelops the town, a series of bizarre murders creates a nightmare of fear. With no help coming from the outside world and no end to the storm in sight, the townspeople are forced to take drastic action before it's too late.",

So he buys the club and turns it into an amusement park. The snooty now ex-club president, Chandler Young, devises a “plan” to discourage Jack from making any more changes to club property which fails at every turn. He also enlists others to try to shut down Jack's low income construction project. The mayhem escalates until Ty Webb steps in and suggests a way that the dispute between the two could be settled like gentlemen — a high-stakes golf match!",

But alas, nothing is so simple. Ronna will soon find herself at the center of a police sting, Claire will be taken hostage, Simon will be shot which will make Todd quite upset, and Zack and Adam will find themselves not only in hot water, but at one bizarre Christmas party.",

Ever since then, the Popes have been on the run with the authorities never far behind. Today, their eldest son wants a life of his own although he is aware that would mean that his parents would either get caught or he will never see them again.",

A pawn in a game played with living pieces, Gally finds herself set into motion against such foes as brutal spine thieves, the brain-eating gladiator Greweicia, the sinister Mr. Vector and the beautiful but ruthless Dr. Chiren. The greatest threat of all, however, comes from Gally's own employers. When the mysterious Factory orders the execution of her best friend, Gally must make a terrible choice between her own code of honor and the life of the man she loves.",

His wild, hard-partying roommate, Cooper Frederickson, on the other hand, is a spoiled rich kid who never studies and spends his time getting drunk and ogling coeds. Before long, Cooper's fun-filled lifestyle has corrupted Josh, and both are on the verge of flunking out of school. That's when they discover a little-used codicil in the college's charter stating that any student whose roommate commits suicide will automatically receive straight A's. Since their third roommate has moved in with his girlfriend, Josh and Cooper set about recruiting the most depressed, suicidal classmate they can find. The prime candidate: Cliff, a mentally unbalanced wild man.",

        "description": "This film adaptation of George Orwell's semi autobiographical novel pares material down into a more concise chapter in the struggle for artistry as experienced by Gordon Comstock. At New Albion Publicity he's the best copywriter they've ever had, and long-suffering girlfriend Rosemary knows it. Unfortunately, Gordon quits to concentrate on writing poetry. Post-WWI London is reluctant to accommodate him however, and not even the aspidistra plant at his lodgings will give him an answer despite screaming obscenities at it. Veering between successes and failures, this is the story of coming to terms with a society that no longer has a place for free-ranging artists.",

The haggard crew of the dilapidated Dark Star spaceship--Doolittle, Boiler, Pinback, and Talby -- is on an extended mission to seek out and destroy unstable planets. But after 20 years of the same routine, each crewmember is reaching the end of his tether. The journey is fraught with mishaps, and danger seems to lurk around every corner. There are misbehaving pet aliens, suicidal bombs that dream of detonating, frozen crewmates dispensing advice from beyond the grave, and a surly, unhelpful main computer that holds the men it serves in total contempt. Despite all these problems, the crew is still bored to the brink of madness.",

In 1960, Martin and Tony Award - winner Cyril Ritchard returned to perform this treasured classic for the last time - now richly preserved in color, with all of the immediacy and technical imperfections of live television. Hum along with the unforgettable score (\"I Won't Grow Up,\" \"Never-Never Land,\" I'm Flying,\" and more) as Peter Pan transports you back to that wonderful place \"where dreams are born and time is never planned.\"",

In \"Homo,\" a prisoner in Fontenal prison is drawn to an inmate whom he knew some years before, at Baton juvenile institute, and whose humiliations he witnessed.
