Eventually, Day converted to Roman Catholicism and dedicated the rest of her life to helping the poor.",

        "description": "Elvis: The Complete Story is a unique look at all 33 feature films made by the one and only ‘King of Rock and Roll’. The familiar history takes on a new and vibrant feel as the words and thoughts of Elvis guide you through his meteoric rise to worldwide fame. From his dirt-poor childhood in the rural south, to his gift to the world of a new kind of music. We ride the souped up Cadillac of success from the backroads of Memphis to the gold paved streets of Hollywood. Film Clips and scenes from his pictures highlight Presley’s rise to fame and provide a look at the real Elvis behind the mask of the superstar.\nFeatured is Elvis' debut performance in Love Me Tender, leading to dramatic roles in Loving You and Jailhouse Rock, character parts in King Creole and Flaming Star and continuing on to the colorful adventure comedies of G.I. Blues, Viva Las Vegas and Kid Galahad. Many other films followed through the years, until finally, Elvis regained his position as the world's top entertainer in his last two mega-hit live performance films; Elvis On Tour and Elvis, That's The Way It Is. \nYou will see a caring and tormented artist, beloved by millions, who could never come to terms with himself. You will witness his devotion to his mother, his generosity, his mood swings, and his unstoppable musical genius. This outstanding, two hour documentary special also features original music, rare early television appearances, behind the scene footage, and insightful interviews with some of The King's most famous co-stars.",
