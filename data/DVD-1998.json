Each does this in his own way and is changed for life.",

Unaccustomed to suburban life, fun-loving Uncle Buck soon charms his younger relatives Miles and Maizy with his hefty cooking and his new way of doing the laundry. His carefree style does not impress everyone though - especially his rebellious teenage niece, Tia, and his impatient girlfriend, Chanice. With a little bit of luck and a lot of love, Uncle Buck manages to surprise everyone in this heartwarming family comedy.",

        "description": "Set in the year 2029 and following World Wars III and IV, a Japanese-led Asian block dominates world affairs. The alliance maintains its international supremacy through its elite security force whose cybernetically enhanced operatives tackle an array of hi-tech terrorists and other threats to international security. These augmented agents can \"ghost hack\" (i.e., download their consciousness) via the now omnipresent internet into other machines and human/machine cross breeds. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cybernetically augmented female agent, has been tracking a virtual entity known as the Puppet Master with her crack squad of security agents. The shape-shifting Puppet Master, a rogue creation of a rival agency of the security apparatus, has concluded that it is a life form in its own right, \"born in sea of information,\" and requested political asylum and true physical existence in defiance of its creators.",

Blessed in life with extraordinary killing skills, Simmons is even more deadly with the backing of his new master and the changling powers he has at his disposal. As he begins to discover and exercise his new strengths, he encounters two figures who direct him to use his powers in order to serve two different agendas. Cogliostro encourages Spawn to fight the devil and become a new champion for humankind, while Clown goads Spawn into continuing to serve his new master and lead the Armageddon.",

When a gunfight breaks out, Keats is accidentally shot in the head by Moses in the ensuing melee. After recovering, Keats returns to work only to find that his first assignment is to escort his ex-best friend back home from Arizona, so Moses can turn state's evidence against the ruthless drug king pin he was working for. Hardly a happy traveling duo, they soon discover that there's a mole revealing their every move and that they are neither safe from the police, the FBI nor the drug thugs hot on their trail. Although they hate each other now, they soon realize that with their lives at stake, the original ties that bind are still strong--especially if it means surviving.",

It's the ultimate teen party, a once-in-a-lifetime alternate universe where class nerds become class studs, super-jocks are humiliated, and freshman crushes blossom into grown-up romance. From prom queen to bimbo, meathead to misfit, everyone will be there for a hormone-charged bash tapped for out-of-control fun.",

Sparks fly, and the pair go home together to enjoy what they think is going to be a meaningless night of sex, preferring casual sex to commitment. Danny and Debbie both enjoy their own freedom, work, and friendships. Debbie relies on the support of her roommate, Joan, a cynical kindergarten teacher, while Danny is constantly exchanging dirty stories and work anecdotes with his coworker and best friend, Bernie. Although they desire to keep their independence, Danny and Debbie begin spending more and more time with each other and finally end up moving in together, quickly becoming domesticated in spite of their fears. However, their whirlwind romance gets the better of them and, although they have strong feelings for one another, they break up. Emotionally devastated, they both attempt to move on while realizing that they may have had something more important than their supposed freedom. This in-depth look at the difficulties of modern relationships is insightful and sexy, featuring palpable chemistry between the two seductive stars.",

A mysterious shadow kidnaps first Akane's sister Kasumi, then continues on until all the girls disappear. All except everyone's favorite hydro-transsexual. As an ambush, Ranma's set out to trap one of the shadows, revealing them to be under the control of a powerful prince Toma. Toma is the young prince of a floating island to which only males are born due to a powerful spring which turns anything into a man. Of course, he's out to rescue the girls, but more importantly, can he get a hold of the water that may free him of the Jusenkyo curse? And even more importantly, can he keep his mouth shut before Akane does more damage to him then Prince Toma does?",

The old Indian woods hold many mysteries — stories of murder and strange disappearances that the townspeople of Haven have passed from generation to generation. But when Bobbi (Marg Helgenberger) stumbles across a strange object buried behind her house, these legends become frighteningly real. As Bobbi and Gardner (Jimmy Smits) become obsessed with the amazing powers this object has given off, they unwittingly release a long sleeping ancient evil that again comes alive with a horrific and deadly force: a force that threatens to control all of the townspeople, pushing them forward on a mission that could destroy all of Haven.",

With a dossier boasting 74 confirmed kills, he may be ready for his final assignment. But is he ready for his toughest? As his spotter, the Pentagon has chosen GS-9 Richard Miller (Zane) — a silver-medal marksman aiming for a Washington promotion. Together the bush-savvy gunner and the inexperienced bureaucrat must track down and eliminate a powerful rebel leader and his Columbian drug-lord financier. It's a suicide mission into the jungles of Central America, where a man carries his life in his hands — and lives it one bullet at a time.",

Warming up with \"Could You Be Loved\" and \"Feeling Alright,\" Cocker soon finds his footing and launches into the Scotch whiskey soul of \"Have a Little Faith,\" the kinky comedy of \"You Can Leave Your Hat On,\" and the gospel-flushed agony of \"When the Night Comes.\" A take on Van Morrison's \"Into the Mystic\" is welcome, while \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\" mines the old Animals chestnut for further blues testimony. The crumpled valentine of \"You Are So Beautiful\" is touchingly familiar and dedicated, on this occasion, to the late Princess Diana. In all, Cocker is in very good, professional form here, a tempered force of nature, perhaps, but an expressive stylist of mature conviction.",

        "description": "To celebrate 10 years as the world's most popular musical, the cast of Les Mis‚rables threw a phenomenal birthday party at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1995. A decade after Trevor Nunn directed its premiere at the Barbican Centre, and the subsequent move into what became a permanent home at the West End Palace Theatre, producer Cameron Macintosh felt the time had come for a little outing for \"the miserables.\" Conductor David Charles Abell, having climbed out of the cluttered Palace pit, for one glorious night has the entire Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at his disposal and there are appearances from over 150 singers--birthday celebs from Les Mis stagings worldwide--who flocked to the grandiose venue. Hosts for the night are the 1995 London cast: Colm Wilkinson's Valjean has power and beauty in \"Who Am I?\" and \"Bring Him Home,\" and Michael Ball is a charming Marius. Miss Saigon herself, Lea Salonga, gets the crowd-pleasing favorite \"On My Own.\" The Albert Hall sounds filled to the brim with an appreciative audience that contributes to the festive atmosphere. The result is a real treat for fans and lovers of Boubil and Sch”nberg's greatest musical.",

Kennedy's 1963 assassination, which was filmed by Abraham Zapruder--provoked a storm of controversy when it first appeared on video shelves. Added to the National Film Registry in 1994, this historical document remains a significant record of one of the nation's most devastating events and is still cited as a key piece of evidence in the debate over the truth of Kennedy's murder. This unprecedented release has been digitally mastered with the approval of the Zapruder family. An accompanying documentary, which explores the mastering process in detail, features a short portrait of Zapruder. \nOne of the most important documents of the 20th century is now available to the public for the very first time. Witness the assassination of president John F. Kennedy in the first-ever digitally enlarged version of the zapruder film.",

        "description": "Wayans plays U.S. Marine Sgt. James Dunn, a military hero who refuses an order to shoot a young shepherd during the Gulf War. His insubordination leads to a lethal struggle with a superior officer and a subsequent murder conviction against Dunn. Plucked from his death sentence by a covert unit of Marines, however, Dunn soon finds himself in a shadowy world of undercover wars under the command of one Lt. Col. Grant Casey. Offered freedom in exchange for aiding a mission against a corrupt industrialist, Dunn agrees and then discovers he's actually been set up to take the fall for an assassination. Suddenly, he's the most wanted man in the world, with police, the military, the Secret Service, and legions of reward seekers chasing him around Los Angeles.",

Now, four small-time crooks are on the run with a suitcase full of cocaine, two yuppie hostages, and too many secrets to keep. In his theatrical feature directorial debut, Kiefer Sutherland orchestrates a gritty story of lost second chances along the back roads of America's once-wild West. Those back roads lead to a small town in New Mexico where the foursome hope to sell the goods and where the local law, the feds and the drug mob's ruthless enforcers will meet them for an explosive showdown.",

While the great Elizabethan age of entertainment unfolds around him, Will is without inspiration on material. What Will needs is a muse--and in an extraordinary moment in which life imitates art, he finds and falls for a woman who draws him into his own dramatic adventure of star-crossed love. It all begins when Lady Viola, desperate to become an actor at a time when women were forbidden from such depravity, disguises herself as a man to audition for Will's play. But the guise slips away as their passion ignites. Now Will's quill again begins to flow, this time turning love into words, as Viola becomes his real-life Juliet and Romeo finds his reason to exist. Yet all is not well in Will's world. For even as the parchment begins to pile up, he's plagued by the fact that Lady Viola must marry the insufferable Lord Wessex.",

Severe flooding threatens an Indiana town after a massive rainstorm taxes dams to the breaking point. As part of an emergency evacuation effort, armored car driver Tom and his uncle Charlie are recruited to collect cash from the town's banks and drive it to safety. However, a gang of thieves led by Jim plan to lay siege to the truck and steal the $3 million on board. After Jim attempts to ambush the truck, Tom hides the cash and reports the attempted theft to the local sheriff. However, the sheriff's lack of honesty soon becomes apparent; he puts Tom in a lockup and sets out to take the money for himself. As the flood waters rise, Tom has to escape from jail if he is to save both the townspeople's savings and his own life. Meanwhile, Jim and the sheriff are locked in a race to see who can find the $3 million first.",

John can't be bothered with apathy, but no matter how much he wants to help people, he is too immobilized to do anything useful. Haunted by chronic insomnia and impending sense of doom, all he can do is watch, and John is an avid observer. Through his voyeuristic binoculars, he struggles to make sense of all the alienation and disaffection he sees in his neighborhood. In his journal he meticulously chronicles the mundane down to steadfast march of ants across his kitchen counter. John is desperately trying to keep one meaningless day from blending into next. He compulsively watches homemade videos of LA riots looking for a clue. But everywhere around him the city's social fabric is coming apart at the seams, and now it is John Boys's own threadbare life that's about to unravel.",

On the run from an evil and oppressive sect known as the Holns, the drifter retreats to the woods of the Northwestern U.S. and assumes the identity of a postal employee when he inadvertantly stumbles upon a wrecked postal vehicle. Although the United States government has long been disbanded, The Postman begins to deliver the mail—providing a sense of hope to the frightened locals who have for too long lived under the Holn's oppressive ways.",

Throughout the movie, Nico’s music plays practically non-stop: enigmatic dirges of longing and bitterness torn from a soul drugged to numbness by her successive environments (postwar Germany, Warhol’s Factory, life on the road). With extraordinary technique, Ofteringer paints a moody, melancholy picture of a legend who decayed into the ghost of herself.",

Through the history of mankind, the times that are most recorded in mythology are those of great deeds and fantastic adventures. Such a time was the Hyborean Age and the story of Conan the Barbarian. Cimmerian Conan is captured after his parents' savage murder by raiding Vanir led by Thulsa Doom, head  of the malignant snake-cult of Set. Fifteen years' agony, first chained to the Wheel of Pain grinding grain and then enslaved as a Pit Fighter, forge a magnificent body and indomitable spirit. Freed  one day by his owner, Conan, with his companions Subotai the Mongol  and Valeria, Queen of Thieves, sets forth upon his quest to learn \"the riddle of steel\" which his father prophesied would confer ultimate power, and to kill his enemy Thulsa Doom.",

However, he becomes the object of bullying by Cobra Kai, a menacing gang of karate students, when he strikes up a relationship with Ali, the Cobra Kai leader's ex-girlfriend. Eager to fight back and impress his new girlfriend but afraid to confront the dangerous gang, Daniel asks his handyman Mr. Miyagi, whom he learns is a master of the martial arts, to teach him karate. Mr. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate is a mastery over the self, mind, and body and that fighting is always the last answer to a problem. Under Mr. Miyagi's guidance, Daniel develops not only physical skills but also the faith and self-confidence to compete despite tremendous odds.",

Keir Dullea is Private Doll, who dreads the invasion and steals a pistol to help him protect himself. Sergeant Welsh (Jack Warden), a caustic, battle-scarred veteran, hates Doll, whom he considers a coward. In battle, Doll kills a Japanese soldier and is filled with remorse, which further angers the sergeant. The next day, an emboldened Doll wipes out an entire enemy machine gun post and begins to feel as sadistic as Welsh. The two must work together to clear away some mines, but as they do, their platoon is surprised by a Japanese raid.",

But as Lemnear soon discovers, a greater destiny lies ahead than simply being the messenger of revenge. Within her lies an almost invincible power. A power which could free all mankind. A power the Dark Lord will do anything to possess. From the slave pits of the Dark Lord's minions, to the horror of his impregnable flying fortress, Lemnear must journey to confront the face of pure evil. Can she live up to her role of the prophecy, or will she be consumed in the Dark Lord's holocaust of conquest?",

When a number of New Yorkers are brutally decapitated while sunbathing on their tenement building roof, two NYPD detectives are assigned to solve the case. Meanwhile, paranoid jewel thief Jimmy Quinn (Michael Moriarty) flees a botched heist and hides out on the roof of the Chrysler Building, where he unwittingly discovers the nest of the huge dragon-like creature that has been responsible for the deaths. As Quinn bargains with the police for a financial reward for his information about the creature's nest, a mysterious Aztec cult in the city start making human sacrifices to call on the creature they believe is Quetzalcoatl, the Plumed Serpent. Can the police get the location of the nest before more people are killed? And, once there, can they destroy the monstrous creature?",

Lizzie recruits Rudolf, the boyishly charming town misfit. Reluctantly, Zobel allows Rudolf to join them but warns him to never break the golden rule: \"No exchanging of bodily fluids within the team.\" This dictum becomes increasingly difficult to live by as Lizzie's cravings and Zobel's own passions toward Rudolf intensify. Eventually, the golden rule is broken by Lizzie...and then again by Zobel (unbeknownst to Lizzie, of course). An intricate love triangle soon develops amongst the three that is shaped by deception, desire, and betrayal.",

Together, a group of teenagers face the pressures of their maturing sexuality, the formation of their political ideals during a turbulent period in French politics, and the stress of completing their Baccalaureate exam. Tension is brought to a head when Henri, an older, militant Algerian-born \"Pied-Noir\" refugee (an Algerian born French national), begins attending the same boarding school as the two boys. His radical politics and more sophisticated sexuality creates a disruptive element in their quiet provincial milieu.",

It is the epic story of two families, one northern and one southern, during and after the Civil War. D. W. Griffith's masterful direction combines brilliant battle scenes and tender romance with a vicious portrayal of African-Americans. It was the greatest feature-length blockbuster yet to be produced in the United States and the first to be shown in the White House. After seeing it, President Woodrow Wilson remarked it was \"like writing history with lightning!\"",

To complicate matters even further, Pomeroy (Costello) has fallen for Patty, one of The Andrews Sisters, and puts on a charade to impress her.

As he recovers he finds himself to be the only man in a wild western town inhabited by beautiful, gun slingin', whiskey drinkin' women. Peace, harmony and boredom abound in Puckerbush Gulch until word gets out that for the first time in twenty years, there's a man in their midst. Best friends become bitter foes as the sex-crazed cowgirls corral the Commander one by one. Lost in space with no way home, can our hero find true happiness, or will he be pushin' up daisies from pure exhaustion?",

It turns out, however, that their ship is the subject of a Paranoid experiment. In the end, it is up to the remaining crew Star Leaf to defend the artificial paradise of Chaos from the Paranoid fleet and the plans of the Solenoid leaders.",

Once upon a time, a band of scholars set out to write a new encyclopedia. By their ninth year, the grumpy grammarian of the group, Bertram Potts (Cooper), is up to \"S\" for slang. In order to brush up on modern lingo, the professor decides to attend a bawdy nightclub, where he meets Sugarpuss O'Shea (Stanwyck), a burlesque queen who spices up his language and steals his heart.

Shaw, as usual, gives a riveting performance, but Plummer's simmering portrayal of hate, love and confusion screams even louder than the blood curdling cries of Incas slaughtered by Pizarro's conquistadors across the dusty landscape.\nTwo cultures, worlds apart in language and tradition but eerily similar, each rival doomed by his own basic nature – blinding bigotry and undying belief in his own spiritual supremacy.",

        "description": "Oscar winner Helen Mirren is Detective Jane Tennison, \"one of the great character creations of our time\" (The Washington Post), in a series that won more than 20 major international awards and raised the bar for police dramas. Tenacious, driven, and deeply flawed, Tennison rises through the ranks of Britain's Metropolitan Police, solving horrific crimes while battling office sexism and her own demons. \"Rare is the drama that works so well on two levels: as a crackling whodunit and as a finely  tuned character study of a strong but insecure woman trying to prove herself in a man's world\" (Time).\nIn Series 1, DCI Tennison seizes the opportunity to head a murder investigation after years of being passed over by her male supervisors.",

Can anyone stop Lorna before her perverse stage show becomes a murderous reality?\nStarring the beautiful Janine Reynaud ( TWO UNDERCOVER ANGELS, KISS ME, MONSTER ), Jack Taylor ( THE GHOST GALLEON, THE NINTH GATE ) and Howard Vernon ( THE AWFUL DR. ORLOFF, DELICATESSEN ), Jess Franco‘s ( 99 WOMEN, VAMPYROS LESBOS ) Faustian fever dream provides the blue-print for the erotic horror that has become the infamous director’s enduring legacy.

Severe flooding threatens an Indiana town after a massive rainstorm taxes dams to the breaking point. As part of an emergency evacuation effort, armored car driver Tom and his uncle Charlie are recruited to collect cash from the town's banks and drive it to safety. However, a gang of thieves led by Jim plan to lay siege to the truck and steal the $3 million on board. After Jim attempts to ambush the truck, Tom hides the cash and reports the attempted theft to the local sheriff. However, the sheriff's lack of honesty soon becomes apparent; he puts Tom in a lockup and sets out to take the money for himself. As the flood waters rise, Tom has to escape from jail if he is to save both the townspeople's savings and his own life. Meanwhile, Jim and the sheriff are locked in a race to see who can find the $3 million first.",

This is the only video in the Jerry Springer home video series that is actually a full-length show, rather than just clipped highlights. Adara works and lives without a stitch of clothing to sheathe her body. Grocery shopping, walking around town, working as half of the duo entitled Scandalous, Adara simply feels it is more natural and more comfortable to be nude. Sitting on the stage, wearing nothing but thigh-high lace-up boots, she makes the case for nudity. While her boyfriend is supportive, her mother and sister are less than enthusiastic. Her tearful mother pleads with her to cover up. She is soon joined by best friend Amanda, whose boyfriend confronts her with the ultimatum: it's either me or your nudity.",

Cimmerian Conan is captured after his parents' savage murder by raiding Vanir led by Thulsa Doom, head  of the malignant snake-cult of Set. Fifteen years' agony, first chained to the Wheel of Pain grinding grain and then enslaved as a Pit Fighter, forge a magnificent body and indomitable spirit. Freed  one day by his owner, Conan, with his companions Subotai the Mongol  and Valeria, Queen of Thieves, sets forth upon his quest to learn \"the riddle of steel\" which his father prophesied would confer ultimate power, and to kill his enemy Thulsa Doom.",

One shot. One kill. No exceptions. By that hard and fast rule, legendary Marine sniper Tom Beckett (Berenger) serves his lonely duty. With a dossier boasting 74 confirmed kills, he may be ready for his final assignment. But is he ready for his toughest?

Together the bush-savvy gunner and the inexperienced bureaucrat must track down and eliminate a powerful rebel leader and his Columbian drug-lord financier. It's a suicide mission into the jungles of Central America, where a man carries his life in his hands — and lives it one bullet at a time.",

Driven to breaking point, the forces of law and order are left with no choice but to use the very criminals they capture to help hunt their own kind.\nEnter hardened cybercriminals Sengoku, Gogul, and Benten. Presented by police chief Hasegawa with a stark choice, they must decide to either rot in jail for the rest of their lives, or join a special force of the Cyber Police and possibly get one more chance at freedom. With their less than subtle blend of extreme violence and excessive swearing, some hard justice is coming to Oedo.\nWith each criminal apprehended and each successful mission completed, the state will agree to reduce their sentences. But with each of them serving a 300-year stretch, and Hasegawa keeping them in line with explosive collars, will they survive long enough to be free men once again?",
