Based on the true story of one of the greatest moments in sports history, the tale captures a time and place where differences could be settled by games and a cold war could be put on ice. In 1980, the United States Ice Hockey team's coach, Herb Brooks, took a ragtag squad of college kids up against the legendary juggernaut from the Soviet Union at the Olympic Games. Despite the long odds, Team USA carried the pride of a nation yearning from a distraction from world events. With the world watching the team rose to the occasion, prompting broadcaster Al Michaels' now famous question, to the millions viewing at home: \"Do you believe in miracles? Yes!\"",

Surprise, when they're suddenly attacked by a superior enemy. With the Surprise badly damaged and much of his crew injured, Aubrey is torn between duty and friendship as he pursues a high-stakes chase across two oceans, to intercept and capture his foe. It's a mission that can make his reputation -- or destroy Lucky Jack and his crew. In the course of the characters' epic journey, the movie travels the world -- from the coast of Brazil to the storm-tossed waters of Cape Horn, south through ice and snow, to the far side of the world, to the remote shores of The Galapagos Islands. Based on author Patrick O'Brian's series of Aubrey/Maturin novels, the story is set during the Napoleonic Wars.",

Behind him we hear the baying of a hound, a sound so fearful it chills the soul. The man falls. From the desolate rocky landscape another man peers; he is bearded and rough looking, perhaps a convict escaped from the nearby prison. At the great house that looms in the darkness, Baskerville Hall, a servant woman opens the door, lantern in hand, and finds her master, Sir Charles Baskerville dead. Considered by many as the best film in the series, Rathbone and Bruce establish themselves as the indisputable Holmes and Watson. Richard Green, Lionel Atwill and John Carradine make up the rest of the cast in this atmospheric thriller.",

While Wuornos confessed to the six murders, including a policeman, she claimed to have killed only in self-defense, resisting violent assaults while working as a prostitute. In 1989-90, a love story unfolds in the midst of the horrors and pathologies of two misfits: Wuornos (Charlize Theron), a drifter prostitute and Selby Wall (Christina Ricci), sent by her parents to live with an aunt in Florida in order to \"cure her \nhomosexuality\". Nearing suicidal despair, Aileen wanders into a bar, where she meets Selby and falls in love. To keep her and Selby's relationship alive, she continues hooking, only to fuel an increasingly escalating deadly rage, a fury vented with a lurid string of killings and the media's sordid designation of her as the first female serial killer--a monster.",
