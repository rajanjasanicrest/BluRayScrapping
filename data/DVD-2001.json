        "description": "Sergeant Joe Gunn is the commander of an American M-3 tank crew allied to the British Eighth Army, which is defeated by the Germans at Tobruk. Joining the scattered retreat across the Libyan desert, Gunn and his two remaining men, Jimmy Doyle and Waco Hoyt search for water. Instead the tank crew finds an international mix of stragglers, including an officer doctor with several soldiers and a British Sudanese sergeant, Tambul, with his Italian prisoner of war. The rag-tag column shoots down an attacking plane and takes its German pilot as a second captive, although a soldier, Fred Clarkson is killed in the fighting. After one well turns out to be dry, the troupe finally reaches an abandoned mosque with a well that provides a trickle of water. Two more prisoners are taken while scouting the area and reveal that an entire German battalion is en route to the same well. Gunn misleads them into believing that there is plenty of water to go around, sets them free to report back to their superiors, and then persuades his fellow Allies to help him fight the enemy force that's en route, even though they are staggeringly outnumbered. A betrayal, an escaped prisoner, and bloody skirmishes follow in short order as Hoyt goes in search of help while Gunn and his compatriots attempt to crush the German battalion.",

George Jung pursued what he thought was the American Dream. Rather than become just another construction worker like his father, George moves to California where he discovers the profitable pleasures of selling marijuana. A spell in prison introduces him to big-time Colombian dealers, and soon George is involved with their plan to export tons of cocaine to US shores. Becoming fabulously wealthy, he will take a dizzying fall that will knock him out of the underworld.",

When diabetes hospitalizes her, the dinners stop and tensions among her three daughters start to break the family apart. Two of the sisters feud continuously: Teri is jealous of Maxine's marriage and irritated that everyone assumes her corporate salary is open to the rest of the family's uses. Maxine resents Teri's bossiness and insensitivity to family tradition. Bird, the youngest, newly married to an ex-con, accepts a favor from an old lover that leads to her husband's arrest. Mama Joe's grandson Ahmad cooks up a scheme to bring the family together, back to the table.",

When the rebel Jack Merridew neglects the fire camp and they lose the chance to be seen by a helicopter, the group split under the leadership of Jack. While Ralph rationalizes the procedures, Jack returns to the primitivism, using the fear for the unknown (in a metaphor to the religion) to control the other boys, and hunting and chasing pigs, stealing the possession of Ralph's group and even killing people.",

Tony is picked on by his new classmates and starts dreaming about vampires at night, until one fine evening his dreams seem to summon Rudolph, an aristocratic, wee vampire. Rudolph is among the vegetarian variety of vampires, but tells Tony that his diet has weakened his flying powers. After Tony guides Rudolph to some unsuspecting cows, on whose blood his new friend feasts, a friendship is born. Rudolph introduces Tony to his father, mother and siblings, all of whom have been in hiding for three centuries as they wait for a comet to pass by that will make them human if they possess a magic amulet. Rudolph's dad, however, is missing part of the amulet, which turns out to have been stolen by Rudolph's uncle centuries ago and is now in the possession of none other than Lord McAshton. To further complicate matters, a vampire hunter is skulking around and causing no end of trouble.",

        "description": "Uprising is based on the true story of the Jewish Fighting Organization, a courageous band of youthful Polish guerrillas and freedom fighters who refused to knuckle under to the Nazis during World War II. Led by schoolteacher Mordechai Anielewicz, the organization comes into being as the Warsaw Jewish ghetto is being systemically decimated and shipped off to the Treblinka death camp by the German occupational forces. From April 19 to May 16, 1943, Anielewicz' followers staged a valiant uprising, which -- though ultimately unsuccessful in stopping the Nazi \"final solution\" juggernaut -- inflicted an enormous amount of damage upon the enemy and enabled hundreds of Polish Jews to escape the gas ovens and crematoriums. Much of the story is based upon the eyewitness testimony of surviving freedom fighter Simha \"Kazik\" Rotem, portrayed in the film by Stephen Moyer. Director Jon Avnet brilliantly combines newly filmed scenes with digitally refashioned archival footage of the actual uprising.",

It would be a summer that no one who knows baseball would forget. Mickey Mantle is a Yankee favorite, a hit with fans and sports writers alike and natural heir to his predecessors Joe DiMaggio, Lou Gehrig, and Babe Ruth. Also at bat is a yound midwesterner, Roger Maris, ahard-hitting right fielder. Maris is Mantle's opposite in almost every way. Quiet and soft-spoken, he doesn't add up to everything a sports legend should be, and finds himself losing the support of the fans. As the summer of 1961 unfolds, both find themselves approaching Babe Ruth's benchmark of 60 home runs. Facing mounting pressure from the media and the stands, they both know there's only room for one winner.",

        "description": "A remarkable ensemble of screen legends, including Stacy Keach, John Hammond, Lloyd Bridges, Colleen Dewhurst, Geraldine Page and Gregory Peck star in one of the most compelling, thoughtful and comprehensive Civil War films ever produced. Based on the works of Pulitzer Prize winner Bruce Catton, THE BLUE &; THE GRAY is recognized for its historical accuracy, dramatic intensity and spectacular battle sequences. Filmed entirely on location in Arkansas with over 160 characters and 6,300 extras, this searing saga contains all the stirring conflict and narrative lyricism of such cinematic masterpieces as GONE WITH THE WIND and GLORY. The film brilliantly reconstructs an eternally fascinating and controversial era in American history when families and nation were divided between black and white, North and South and THE BLUE &; THE GRAY.",

On the heels of her latest play, Camille is shocked to discover that her Aunt Jewel Mae \"Cookie\" Orcutt has committed suicide. Terrified at the thought of how this will tarnish the family name, she eats the suicide note to make it look like a burglary. This set-up leads the police to one main suspect, Willis Richland, who also happens to be Cookie's best friend.",
